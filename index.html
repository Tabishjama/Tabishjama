           The technology shift and  car design  features  are essential  factors in  the automotive  industry's internal and external  environmental  scanning  stage.  
           This  is  important  when  the  technological  shift  may  influence  the advancement and refinement of the latest devices, systems,
           and associated software that automotive manufacturers can  use  to  conduct  their  business  [13].  As  business  players  in  the  automotive  industry,  
           the  automotive manufacturer must be alert to all opportunities to stay competitive in the local market and be competitive in the global economy market.
            A variety of current new technology in the automotive industry such as Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) for alcolock and seatbelt lock, GPS,
             braking and steering system are fuelling innovation impacting strategic planning decisions to  better determine  market trends  to enhanced  car safety  strategy decisions  by  Malaysian OEM  car manufacturers [3].  
           The technology shift becomes the essentials for OEM car manufacturers to create new competitive advantages and stay  competitive in the current  market. 
           For example,  a proudly Malaysian national  brand, PROTON plant located  in TanjungMalim,  uses  robotic technology  and  is  fully  automated  to  perform efficiently  with  a  high volume of production [17]. 
           Therefore, the implementation of lean manufacturing processes in the TanjungMalim plant was an excellent PROTON decision. The rapid growth in the automotive industry  has been the opportunity for Malaysian economy development
            when  the  government provides  an  educated  and skilled  labour  force  through  education institutions  and  skill institutes by implementing Technical  and Vocational Education and  Training  (TVET). This  education training provides  knowledge  and  skills  for  employment. 
             This  situation  currently  allures  the  leading  international automotive players and other related stakeholders, such as vendors for automotive, to support the industry through investment in Malaysia further.

            As a business entity, one of the main factors of success is the product itself. A product with the latest and
exciting feature will help a business entity to boost its appeal to potential buyers. According to [7], there are few
factors to influence product launch success: 4P's product, price, promotion, and place.
Moreover, any product produced is compulsory to fulfil the market needs and buyer's taste [5] in terms of
design features that meet their specifications needs, especially the design concept and features that manage to
offer the safest car for customers [2], [6]. The safest car might help the automotive industry formulate a good
product marketing strategy by highlighting the safety car awareness to targeted potential buyers in their
promotion.
Design features such as autonomous system, Intelligent Transport System (ITS), color, passive safety design,
materials and component used, and body design are the specification required by car manufacturers to ensure the
product offered is safe for their customers. These are a few elements that need to be stressed by the automotive
industry at the designing and manufacturing stage to reduce road accident rates due to several causes. Safety must
become the priority for car manufacturer another cost, and car manufacturer need to make sure the materials and
components used have a significantly less environmental impact if a road accident happens as well as the body car
design must incorporate with the standard of safety, size, and weight, aerodynamics as ASEAN NCAP requires.
Design features will give a good impression of automobile product features, but even though the customers always
want the best features combination, they are only willing to pay for what is necessary to provide the best
advantage for them [10].
